*Road-mapped:* SAT dependency solver, parallel wheel cache, workspaces with
single lockfile, WASM wheel resolution, Conda & Poetry import plugins.

---

## 🔧 Building from source

```bash
# System deps: a C11 compiler, libcurl, libdl (both standard on Linux/macOS),
# and tar/libarchive if you want pypylock bundles.

git clone https://github.com/yourname/pypm.git
cd pypm
cc -Wall -Wextra -ldl -lcurl -o pypm pypm.c
./pypm doctor

# Diagnose your dev box
./pypm doctor

# Spin up a throw-away REPL playground
./pypm sandbox
# ...hack around, then exit – the temp dir vanishes.

# Add the Conda bridge plugin
./pypm plugin add conda https://example.com/plugins/conda.so

# Use it
./pypm plugin run conda install numpy==1.28.2

# Ship an offline bundle
./pypm pypylock -o /tmp/my-app.tgz

pypm.c                ← single-file CLI core (will split into modules)
include/              ← platform shims, TOML/YAML parsers (planned)
plugins/              ← sample plugins (conda bridge, poetry-import, hello-world)
docs/                 ← design notes, C API for plugin authors
README.md             ← you are here

// hello.c
#include <stdio.h>
int pypm_plugin_main(int argc, char **argv) {
    puts("Hello from a plugin 👋");
    return 0;
}

cc -shared -fPIC -o hello.so hello.c
mkdir -p ~/.pypm/plugins
mv hello.so ~/.pypm/plugins/
pypm plugin run hello

## 📚 Extended Description

### 1. Why another Python package manager?

Python’s packaging ecosystem is a vibrant—but fragmented—bazaar of tools:  
`pip` for installing, `venv` or `virtualenv` for isolating, `pipx` for app-style installs,  
`poetry`/`hatch`/`pdm` for workflow sugar, and Conda/Mamba for binary heft.  
Each excels at one slice yet leaves sharp edges when you stitch them together.

`pypm` is an **opinionated reboot** that cherry-picks the best ideas from npm, Cargo, and
Rust’s `uv`, then bakes them into a single, ultra-portable binary:

* **One command** (`pypm`) drives the _entire_ lifecycle.
* Determinism by default—every build is bit-for-bit reproducible.
* A C core keeps startup under ~15 ms and has zero runtime deps aside
  from `libc`, `libdl`, and `libcurl`.
* A **first-class plugin ABI** lets you graft in Conda, Poetry import, or even
  _your own_ solver written in Rust, Go, or Zig.

### 2. Guiding principles

| Principle | Manifestation in `pypm` |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Deterministic everywhere** | Lockfile pins version _and_ SHA-256 + optional Sigstore signature.  The resolver prefers “least-churn” upgrades so CI diffs stay legible. |
| **Speed trumps completeness** | Parallel wheel downloads, a content-addressed global cache, and a lazy SAT solver that stops at the first minimal solution. |
| **Extensibility beats bloat** | Core CLI is ~500 LOC; everything else (Conda, WASI, Poetry import, Docker image builds) lives in plugins. |
| **Cross-platform parity** | Workspace logic, tar bundling, and plugin loading all wrap POSIX + Win32 in thin shims—no “Linux-first” shortcuts. |
| **Security is not an add-on** | `pypm audit` talks to OSV & CVE feeds; lockfile embeds supply-chain metadata; `doctor` surfaces missing SSL/PGP bits _before_ you install. |

# 📝 pypm — Release Notes

---

## 0.0.3-dev  •  25 Jun 2025

### ✨ New & Improved
| Area | What’s new |
|------|------------|
| **Unified source** | v0.0.1 + v0.0.2 code paths merged into **one file** (`pypm.c`) to simplify builds and downstream patches. |
| **Version bump** | Internal string now reports `0.0.3-dev`. |
| **Workspace override** | Honors `PYP_WORKSPACE_ROOT` **and** still climbs for `pypm-workspace.toml`. |
| **Doctor v2.1** | • Counts issues & exits with that value<br>• Inline Python probe now uses a here-doc (no temp files). |
| **Sandbox v2.1** | `-d <DIR>` flag lets you drop directly into any folder; default remains `mkdtemp`. |
| **Plugin fetcher hardening** | • Creates `~/.pypm/plugins` if missing (POSIX + EEXIST safe)<br>• `CURLOPT_FAILONERROR` aborts on HTTP 4xx/5xx<br>• Preserves plugin’s **exit code** for CI. |
| **Hermetic bundle flag** | `pypylock -o <file>` works regardless of flag order; default target is `dist/venv.tar.gz`. |
| **Error surfacing** | `fatal()` now prints underlying `errno` via `perror`, and most `dlopen`/`curl` errors bubble up plainly. |

### 🐞 Fixes
* CLI flags after sub-commands were occasionally skipped by `getopt` → now we set `optind = 2` before parsing sandbox / pypylock options.
* Plugin loader printed success even when `dlsym` failed → now returns non-zero and closes the handle.
* Workspace scan no longer trashes `cwd` for later `getcwd()` calls.

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
1. **Version command** ‐ still a sub-command (`pypm version`), but scripts that grepped `0.0.2` must update.
2. **Doctor exit codes** ‐ same semantics as 0.0.2, but remember the number can now be >1.

### 🛠 Migration Guide (0.0.2 → 0.0.3-dev)
| If you did … | Do this now |
|--------------|-------------|
| `./pypm doctor && echo OK` | Check for non-zero exit (`[[ $? -eq 0 ]]`) _or_ parse the numeric count. |
| Relied on separate `pypm_v002.c` / `pypm_v001.c` | Switch to single `pypm.c`, `make clean ; make`. |
| Hard-coded `dist/venv.tar.gz` in deploy scripts | Pass `-o` if you need a different path. |

### 🗺 Known Issues
* **Windows** build still needs: `LoadLibraryW`, `_mktemp_s`, `bsdtar.exe` fallback. Tracked in [#22].
* `pypylock` uses shell `tar`; systems without BSD/GNU tar will fail. `libarchive` port slated for 0.0.4.
* WASI/Rust/OpenSSL checks are stubs (informational only).

### 🙌 Thanks
* **Dr. Josef K. Edwards** for the merge-fest and design shepherding.
* **@bytebender** for POSIX mkdir patch.
* **@kittenOps** for the `CURLOPT_FAILONERROR` heads-up.

---

## 0.0.2  •  25 Jun 2025  
(unchanged since previous notes)

* Workspace autodetect, Doctor v2, Sandbox upgrade, Plugin add/run, pypylock `-o`.
* Breaking: `--version` flag removed; doctor exits non-zero on issues.

## 0.0.1  •  23 Jun 2025  
Initial proof-of-concept, single-file CLI with basic doctor / sandbox / plugin / pypylock commands.

---

### 🔮 Next up (0.0.4 roadmap tease)
1. **Lockfile parser + wheel copier** for real hermetic bundles.  
2. **libsolv**-backed dependency resolver.  
3. Cross-platform shims (Win/Mac).  
4. WASI toolchain detection & wheel preference.

Thank you for providing the detailed context about PPM (Python Package Manager, or "pypm") by Dr. Q. Josef Kurk Edwards and its integration with "&qchains" (possibly a typo or shorthand for a related project, which I’ll interpret as a chain-related feature or extension). As Grok 3, built by xAI, I’ll upgrade and update the provided `README.md` content into a modern, polished format, incorporating the latest developments (e.g., version 0.0.3-dev as of June 25, 2025), aligning it with the PMLL context, and enhancing it for clarity, structure, and extensibility. The current date and time is 02:57 PM EDT, Wednesday, June 25, 2025, and I’ll work solely from the provided text and prior context (e.g., `PMLL.c`, Python wrapping), avoiding external data.

# pypm - The "npm-style" Package Manager for Python

**Author**: Dr. Q. Josef Kurk Edwards  
**Version**: 0.0.3-dev (Updated: June 25, 2025)  
**License**: [TBD - Suggest MIT or Apache 2.0]  
**CI Status**: [Insert CI Badge]  
**Repository**: [https://github.com/yourname/pypm.git](https://github.com/yourname/pypm.git)

## TL;DR

`pypm` is a fast, deterministic, and hackable Python package manager designed to streamline the entire development lifecycle with a single command. Built with a ~500 LOC portable C core, it supports virtual environments, plugin extensibility, and hermetic bundles for air-gapped deployments. Think of it as a fusion of `npm`, `Cargo`, and `uv`, tailored for Python.

- **One Command**: From virtual env creation to wheel publishing.
- **Deterministic**: Reproducible installs with SHA-256 pinning.
- **Extensible**: Plugin system for custom solvers (e.g., SAT-based PMLL integration).
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on POSIX and Win32 with minimal dependencies.

## ✨ Features (v0.0.3-dev)

| Command            | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `pypm doctor`      | Diagnoses system (Python headers, C compiler, OpenSSL, WASI, etc.) with numeric exit codes. |
| `pypm sandbox [-d DIR]` | Launches an ephemeral shell in a temp dir (or custom `DIR`). |
| `pypm plugin add NAME SRC` | Adds a `.so` plugin from a URL or path to `~/.pypm/plugins/`. |
| `pypm plugin run NAME …` | Executes `pypm_plugin_main()` in the specified plugin. |
| `pypm pypylock [-o FILE]` | Bundles wheels and interpreter into `dist/venv.tar.gz` (or custom `FILE`). |
| `pypm version`     | Displays the current CLI version.                |

### Road-Mapped Features
- **SAT Dependency Solver**: Integrate PMLL for optimized dependency resolution.
- **Parallel Wheel Cache**: Speed up downloads with concurrent fetching.
- **Workspaces**: Single lockfile for multi-project setups.
- **WASM Wheel Resolution**: Support WebAssembly packages.
- **Conda & Poetry Import**: Plugins for ecosystem bridging.

## 🔧 Building from Source

### System Dependencies
- C11 compiler (e.g., `gcc`, `clang`)
- `libcurl` (for plugin downloads)
- `libdl` (dynamic loading, standard on Linux/macOS)
- `tar` or `libarchive` (for `pypylock` bundles, optional)

### Steps
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/pypm.git
cd pypm
cc -Wall -Wextra -ldl -lcurl -o pypm pypm.c
./pypm doctor
```

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Check your dev environment
./pypm doctor

# Start a throw-away REPL playground
./pypm sandbox
# ...hack, then exit to clean up temp dir

# Add a custom plugin (e.g., PMLL solver)
./pypm plugin add pml_solver https://example.com/plugins/pml_solver.so

# Run the plugin
./pypm plugin run pml_solver solve my_project

# Create an offline bundle
./pypm pypylock -o /tmp/my-app.tgz
```

## 📚 Extended Description

### 1. Why Another Python Package Manager?

Python’s packaging ecosystem is rich but fragmented:
- `pip` installs, `venv` isolates, `pipx` handles apps.
- `poetry`/`hatch`/`pdm` offer workflow tools, while `Conda` provides binary strength.
- Stitching these together leaves sharp edges.

`pypm` reimagines this as an **opinionated reboot**, blending:
- **npm’s Simplicity**: Single-command workflows.
- **Cargo’s Determinism**: Reproducible builds.
- **uv’s Speed**: C-powered core with <15ms startup.

| **Extensibility Beats Bloat** | ~500 LOC core; plugins handle Conda, WASI, PMLL, etc. |
| **Cross-Platform Parity** | POSIX + Win32 shims, no Linux-first bias. |
